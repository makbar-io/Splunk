Attempt to learn Splunk and try to built cool projects

Splunk is a widely used Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform that plays a critical role in identifying threats and risks within cybersecurity environments. I first learned about Splunk through the Google IT Support Professional Certification course. Intrigued by its potential, I decided to explore the platform and leverage its capabilities. Splunk’s 60-day trial provided me with an opportunity to experience the full UI and functionality that professionals encounter in corporate settings.

## Initial Challenges and Excitement

When I began using Splunk, it felt overwhelming as it was completely new to me. Despite this, I was excited to dive into its features, starting with the basics of Splunk Processing Language (SPL). The intuitive trial interface and detailed documentation made the learning curve manageable, allowing me to steadily build confidence in navigating and utilizing the platform.

## Certification Efforts

To formalize my skills and demonstrate my competency, I pursued the Splunk Core Certified Power User certification. I saw this certification as an excellent starting point to familiarize myself with the platform’s core functionalities while adding a valuable credential to my resume. In the field of cybersecurity, Splunk has become a ubiquitous tool, making this knowledge and certification highly relevant.
